# Documents

The index for progressive discovery. Start here; open only what the task needs.

A template is the anatomy of a document: its headings and a one-line hint per section, nothing else. How to fill it, and the rules it must satisfy, are the skill named in its first line; a template never restates them.

| Document | Answers | Level |
|---|---|---|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | what exists, the stack, the features, where the API reference is, and how the backend, web, and mobile surfaces are put together | project; a surface or service may keep its own in its folder |
| [PRD.md](PRD.md) | what the product must do, from the user's and the backend's point of view | project; per service where it makes sense |
| [HLD.md](HLD.md) · [LLD.md](LLD.md) | boundaries and APIs; types, UML, schema, contracts | project, and per service |
| [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md) | the domain design product, business, and tech all refer to | project |
| [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) · [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) | how to set up, run, test, and debug it; how to ship it | project |
| `AGENTS.md` · `SOUL.md` | the organization and how every agent carries itself; copied from the brain as they are | project root |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | what shipped, for web, mobile, and backend | project |
| [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) | what the user taught the agents | project |
| [ADR.md](ADR.md) | one decision worth preserving, in `decisions/` | project, and per service |
| `<service>/docs/` | that service's PRD, HLD, LLD, and RCAs | service |

Whether, how, and where a document is written is `documentation` W1–W11.
