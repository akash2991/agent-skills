# Test-Driven Development

## Overview

Write a failing test before writing the code that makes it pass; for a bug, reproduce it with a test before attempting a fix. Tests are proof, "seems right" is not done. Unit tests prove modules; end-to-end tests prove outcomes: every acceptance criterion and every milestone's usable outcome gets a test that a reviewer, the QA persona, or the user can run to confirm the claim, driven the way users use the product. The pyramid below governs how many tests of each kind exist; the rules govern what must be covered.

## When to Use

- Implementing any new logic or behavior; modifying existing functionality; adding edge-case handling.
- Fixing any bug (the Prove-It pattern).
- Writing, changing, deleting, or reviewing a test; deciding what to test for a task; hitting a failing test.
- A story's acceptance criterion or a milestone's usable outcome must be proven by driving the system as a user or a consuming service would.
- The user says "add tests", "make CI green", or "verify it works".
- NOT for pure configuration, documentation, or static content with no behavioral impact.
- NOT for runtime verification in a real browser: `browser-testing-with-devtools`.

## Rules

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| T1 | **End to end, the way users use the product.** An end-to-end test goes through the entry point a user or consuming service actually uses: HTTP API, CLI, UI, message queue; never internal modules. |
| T2 | **Every acceptance criterion has a test; tests are never weakened or skipped to pass; the running app is exercised, not only its tests.** |
| T3 | **Concurrency and race conditions are tested.** |
| T4 | **Canvas testing automation for the web client: to be figured out; say so on the ticket when needed.** |
| T5 | **Performance testing: deferred, and stated on the ticket when it would have applied.** |
| T6 | **Metrics are tested** (bounded labels, emitted where required). |
| T7 | **Each commit is a verified behavior; tests land with the change, not after.** |
| T8 | **CI runs lint, type check, tests, build, and the milestone verification on every PR.** |
| T9 | **Test runner, lint, and format commands are the project's own**; a service overrides them only when it uses a different toolchain. |
| T10 | **Code is testable by construction:** injected dependencies, no inline randomness or clock. |
| T11 | **Until the backend is complete, the frontend tests against contract mocks and the backend returns labelled mock data**. |
| T12 | **Tests run in the agent's own environment with its own DB snapshot or seed**. |

## Discover the Stack First

The TDD cycle is universal; the commands are not (T9). Before writing the first test, discover how *this* repository tests, and use its commands for every RED, GREEN, and verification step:

- **Language and build system** — `package.json`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, a `Makefile`
- **Checked-in wrappers** — prefer `./gradlew`, `./mvnw`, `make test`, or a repo script over globally installed tools
- **Test framework and configuration** — and how it runs a single focused test vs the full suite
- **Existing conventions** — where tests live, how files are named, what patterns neighboring tests follow
- **Documented commands** — README, CONTRIBUTING, and CI workflows show the commands that actually gate merges

Run the repository's focused-test command during the loop and its full-suite command before completion. Never assume a default like `npm test`.

The examples below use TypeScript for illustration; the workflow is identical in any language once you've discovered the project's own tooling.

## The TDD Cycle

```
    RED                GREEN              REFACTOR
 Write a test    Write minimal code    Clean up the
 that fails  ──→  to make it pass  ──→  implementation  ──→  (repeat)
      │                  │                    │
      ▼                  ▼                    ▼
   Test FAILS        Test PASSES         Tests still PASS
```

### Step 1: RED — Write a Failing Test

Write the test first. It must fail. A test that passes immediately proves nothing.

```typescript
// RED: This test fails because createTask doesn't exist yet
describe('TaskService', () => {
  it('creates a task with title and default status', async () => {
    const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });

    expect(task.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(task.title).toBe('Buy groceries');
    expect(task.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(task.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });
});
```

### Step 2: GREEN — Make It Pass

Write the minimum code to make the test pass. Don't over-engineer:

```typescript
// GREEN: Minimal implementation
export async function createTask(input: { title: string }): Promise<Task> {
  const task = {
    id: generateId(),
    title: input.title,
    status: 'pending' as const,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  };
  await db.tasks.insert(task);
  return task;
}
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR — Clean Up

With tests green, improve the code without changing behavior: extract shared logic, improve naming, remove duplication. Run tests after every refactor step to confirm nothing broke.

## The Prove-It Pattern (Bug Fixes)

When a bug is reported, **do not start by trying to fix it.** Start by writing a test that reproduces it.

```
Bug report arrives → write a test that demonstrates the bug → test FAILS (bug confirmed)
  → implement the fix → test PASSES (fix proven) → run the full suite (no regressions)
```

```typescript
// Bug: "Completing a task doesn't update the completedAt timestamp"

// Step 1: Write the reproduction test (it should FAIL)
it('sets completedAt when task is completed', async () => {
  const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Test' });
  const completed = await taskService.completeTask(task.id);

  expect(completed.status).toBe('completed');
  expect(completed.completedAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);  // This fails → bug confirmed
});

// Step 2: Fix the bug
export async function completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task> {
  return db.tasks.update(id, {
    status: 'completed',
    completedAt: new Date(),  // This was missing
  });
}

// Step 3: Test passes → bug fixed, regression guarded
```

For a complex bug, spawn a subagent to write the reproduction test without knowledge of the fix; the main agent verifies it fails, implements the fix, and verifies it passes.

## The Test Pyramid

Most tests are small and fast, with progressively fewer at higher levels:

```
          ╱╲
         ╱  ╲         E2E Tests (~5%)
        ╱    ╲        Full user flows, real entry points
       ╱──────╲
      ╱        ╲      Integration Tests (~15%)
     ╱          ╲     Component interactions, API boundaries
    ╱────────────╲
   ╱              ╲   Unit Tests (~80%)
  ╱                ╲  Pure logic, isolated, milliseconds each
 ╱──────────────────╲
```

The proportions govern volume, not coverage: however few end-to-end tests there are, every acceptance criterion and every milestone outcome has one (T2). **The Beyonce Rule:** if you liked it, you should have put a test on it. Infrastructure changes, refactoring, and migrations are not responsible for catching your bugs; your tests are.

### Test Sizes (Resource Model)

| Size | Constraints | Speed | Example |
|------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Small** | Single process, no I/O, no network, no database | Milliseconds | Pure function tests, data transforms |
| **Medium** | Multi-process OK, localhost only, no external services | Seconds | API tests with test DB, component tests |
| **Large** | Multi-machine OK, external services allowed | Minutes | E2E tests, performance benchmarks, staging integration |

### Decision Guide

```
Is it pure logic with no side effects?                 → Unit test (small)
Does it cross a boundary (API, database, file system)?  → Integration test (medium)
Is it an acceptance criterion or a milestone outcome?   → End-to-end test (large), through the real entry point
```

## End-to-end tests

1. **Pick the entry point** a user or consuming service actually uses (T1). Never call internals.
2. **Write the scenario** from the acceptance criterion: setup, action, observable result. One scenario per criterion (T2).
3. **Make it deterministic**: seeded fixtures, fake clocks, stubbed external providers behind the same interface production uses, isolated data per test (T10, T12).
4. **Assert on outcomes**, not implementation: response body and status, persisted state via the public read path, emitted events, rendered UI text.
5. **Make failures readable**: the assertion message names the criterion and prints the relevant response or state.
6. **Wire it into verification**: add the command to the milestone record and the service `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` commands table; it must run locally and in CI (T8, T9).
7. **Run it before reporting**: paste the command and result into the report's Verified section.

```text
Scenario: <acceptance criterion, verbatim>
  Given <fixture / state>
  When  <action through the entry point>
  Then  <observable result>
  And   <persisted / emitted side effect, via public read path>
```

## When a test fails

1. The test is the specification of a behavior or an acceptance criterion; fix the code, not the assertion (T2).
2. If the criterion itself is wrong, change the ticket first, then the test, and say so in the commit.
3. Never `skip`, `xfail`, loosen a matcher, or widen a timeout just to pass (T2).

## Writing Good Tests

### Test State, Not Interactions

Assert on the *outcome* of an operation, not on which methods were called internally. Tests that verify method call sequences break when you refactor, even if the behavior is unchanged.

```typescript
// Good: Tests what the function does (state-based)
it('returns tasks sorted by creation date, newest first', async () => {
  const tasks = await listTasks({ sortBy: 'createdAt', sortOrder: 'desc' });
  expect(tasks[0].createdAt.getTime())
    .toBeGreaterThan(tasks[1].createdAt.getTime());
});

// Bad: Tests how the function works internally (interaction-based)
it('calls db.query with ORDER BY created_at DESC', async () => {
  await listTasks({ sortBy: 'createdAt', sortOrder: 'desc' });
  expect(db.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('ORDER BY created_at DESC')
  );
});
```

### DAMP Over DRY in Tests

In production code, DRY is usually right. In tests, **DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases)** is better: a test reads like a specification and tells a complete story without tracing through shared helpers. Duplication in tests is acceptable when it makes each test independently understandable.

### Prefer Real Implementations Over Mocks

```
Preference order (most to least preferred):
1. Real implementation  → Highest confidence, catches real bugs
2. Fake                 → In-memory version of a dependency (e.g., fake DB)
3. Stub                 → Returns canned data, no behavior
4. Mock (interaction)   → Verifies method calls — use sparingly
```

**Use mocks only when** the real implementation is too slow, non-deterministic, or has side effects you can't control (external APIs, email sending). Over-mocking creates tests that pass while production breaks.

### Arrange, Act, Assert; One Assertion Per Concept; Descriptive Names

```typescript
describe('TaskService.completeTask', () => {
  it('sets status to completed and records timestamp', () => {
    // Arrange
    const task = createTask({ title: 'Test' });
    // Act
    const completed = completeTask(task.id);
    // Assert
    expect(completed.status).toBe('completed');
  });
  it('throws NotFoundError for non-existent task', ...);
  it('is idempotent — completing an already-completed task is a no-op', ...);
});

// Bad: one test for everything, named "works" or "handles errors"
```

## Test Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Testing implementation details | Tests break when refactoring even if behavior is unchanged | Test inputs and outputs, not internal structure |
| Flaky tests (timing, order-dependent) | Erode trust in the test suite | Deterministic assertions, isolated test state |
| Testing framework code | Wastes time testing third-party behavior | Only test YOUR code |
| Snapshot abuse | Large snapshots nobody reviews, break on any change | Use snapshots sparingly and review every change |
| No test isolation | Tests pass individually but fail together | Each test sets up and tears down its own state |
| Mocking everything | Tests pass but production breaks | Real implementations > fakes > stubs > mocks; mock only at slow or non-deterministic boundaries |
| Shared mutable fixtures between scenarios | One scenario's state leaks into another | Isolated data per scenario (T12) |

## Browser verification

Runtime verification in a real browser (DOM, console, network, screenshots) is the web agent's `browser-testing-with-devtools`; it complements the tests here, it does not replace them.

## See Also

For JavaScript/TypeScript testing patterns illustrating these principles — Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, Playwright — see `../../references/testing-patterns.md`. The principles transfer to any ecosystem; the syntax and tools there are JS/TS-specific.

## Interaction with other skills

- `browser-testing-with-devtools` is the web agent's runtime verification in a real browser; it complements these tests, it does not replace them.
- `development-setup` provides the environment and the contract mocks tests run against; `coding-standards` makes code testable by construction; `observability-and-instrumentation` defines the metrics T6 tests.
- `linear` is where a wrong acceptance criterion is corrected before its test changes.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll write tests after the code works" | You won't. And tests written after the fact test implementation, not behavior. Tests land with the change (T7). |
| "This is too simple to test" | Simple code gets complicated. The test documents the expected behavior. |
| "Tests slow me down" | Tests slow you down now. They speed you up every time you change the code later. |
| "I tested it manually" | Manual testing doesn't persist. Tomorrow's change might break it with no way to know. |
| "Unit tests cover it." | They cover the pieces. The outcome is the integration of the pieces; every acceptance criterion gets an end-to-end test (T1, T2). |
| "The tests pass, no need to run the app." | The running app is exercised, not only its tests (T2). |
| "Loosening the matcher gets CI green faster." | Tests are never weakened or skipped to pass; fix the code, not the assertion (T2). |
| "Race conditions are too hard to test." | Concurrency and race conditions are tested (T3). |
| "I'll hit the real external API." | Then the test is flaky and costs money. Stub behind the production interface. |
| "Asserting on the DB row directly is easier." | It couples the test to storage. Read through the public path the product uses. |
| "It's slow, we'll run it sometimes." | A test that does not run in verification proves nothing. Keep it fast by scoping, not by skipping. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production code. Tests from day one prevent the test-debt crisis. |
| "Let me run the tests again just to be extra sure" | After a clean run, repeating the same command adds nothing unless the code has changed since. |

## Red Flags

- Writing code without any corresponding tests; a commit whose tests arrive in a later commit (T7).
- Reaching for a default test command (`npm test`) without checking what this repository actually uses (T9).
- Tests that pass on the first run; "all tests pass" but no tests were actually run.
- Bug fixes without reproduction tests.
- An acceptance criterion with no test mapped to it; a milestone marked verified with no runnable end-to-end command (T2).
- An end-to-end test that imports internal modules, or asserts on private fields and internal calls (T1).
- A `skip`, `xfail`, loosened matcher, or widened timeout added to get green (T2).
- Tests that test framework behavior; test names that don't describe the expected behavior.
- Canvas automation or performance testing silently omitted instead of stated as deferred on the ticket (T4, T5).
- Running the same test command twice in a row without any intervening code change.

## Verification

After completing any implementation:

- [ ] Every new behavior has a test; every acceptance criterion has an end-to-end test through the real entry point (T1, T2).
- [ ] Bug fixes include a reproduction test that failed before the fix.
- [ ] The full suite passes, run with the repository's own command (T9); acceptance-criterion tests pass in CI (T8).
- [ ] You ran the app (localhost or device) and used the feature as a user would (T2).
- [ ] Race-prone paths (double submit, concurrent writes) have a test (T3).
- [ ] No tests were skipped, disabled, or weakened to pass (T2); tests are deterministic across three consecutive runs.
- [ ] The end-to-end command is in the milestone record and the report's Verified section quotes the command and result.
- [ ] Anything deferred (canvas automation, performance) is stated on the ticket (T4, T5).
