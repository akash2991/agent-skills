name: github
description: Operates GitHub for the organization through the GitHub MCP server or the gh CLI: branches, pull requests with the PR template, review requests, inline review comments and verdicts, PR status checks, merges, releases with semver tags, and linking PRs to tracker tickets. Use when a staff engineer raises or updates a PR, a code reviewer reviews one, an EM merges or cuts a release, or any persona needs PR or CI state.

# GitHub

## Overview

GitHub is where code review happens and CI runs; the tracker is where state lives. This skill maps the org's PR flow (`../../references/pull-request.md`) onto GitHub operations and keeps the ticket and the PR in sync. Prefer the GitHub MCP server when the tool has it; the `gh` CLI is the equivalent fallback in any tool with a shell.

## When to Use

- Raising, updating, or re-requesting review on a PR.
- Posting inline review comments and a review verdict.
- Checking CI status or merging an approved PR.
- Cutting a release: tag, changelog entry, GitHub release.
- NOT for tracking work: states, blockers, and reports live in the tracker.
- NOT for editing code under review; reviewers comment, authors change.

## Setup

The build emits this server into each tool's repo-level MCP config (`.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, `opencode.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`) with the tool's own environment-variable syntax. Tools with only a global config (Codex, Kimi, others) and the CLI fallbacks are covered in `../../references/tool-auth.md`. Verify with a read-only call before writing anything.

## Operation mapping

| Org action | MCP / `gh` |
|---|---|
| Create branch `<ticket>-<slug>` | `create_branch` / `git switch -c` |
| Raise PR with the template | `create_pull_request` / `gh pr create --title "<ticket>: <goal>" --body-file <template>` |
| Link PR to the ticket | PR title starts with the ticket id; paste the PR URL into the ticket's `PR:` line and status update |
| Request review from the discipline reviewer | `request_reviewers` / `gh pr edit --add-reviewer` (or assign the reviewer persona via the EM) |
| Inline review comment at a line | `create_pending_pull_request_review` + `add_comment_to_pending_review` / `gh api` review comments |
| Verdict | `submit_pending_pull_request_review` with `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `COMMENT` / `gh pr review --approve\|--request-changes` |
| Resolve a comment | reply then resolve the thread; never resolve silently |
| CI status | `get_pull_request_status` / `gh pr checks` |
| Merge (squash, ticket id in message) | `merge_pull_request` / `gh pr merge --squash` |
| Release | tag `vX.Y.Z` per semver, changelog entry, `gh release create` |

## Process

1. **Read before write**: find the existing branch or PR for the ticket; never open a duplicate.
2. **Author**: branch, commit with the ticket id, run verification, raise the PR with the template, put the URL on the ticket with a status update, request the reviewer.
3. **Reviewer**: read tests then diff, post inline comments at lines, submit one review with the verdict, post `merge-review.md` as the summary and on the ticket, move the ticket.
4. **Author again**: address every comment with a commit or a reply, resolve threads, re-request review; the ticket goes back to `In Review`.
5. **Merge**: only after `Approve` (or CI-green author-merge for small blast radius); squash with the ticket id; delete the branch; ticket to `Engineer Verified`; changelog line.
6. **Release** (EM): bump semver, publish the changelog entry listing tickets, tag, create the release.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll merge and open the PR afterwards for the record." | The PR is the review. Nothing merges without it. |
| "I'll put my review in the ticket comment only." | Reviewers comment on the code, at the line. The ticket gets the summary. |
| "The check is flaky, merge anyway." | A red check is a blocker; fix it or escalate. |
| "I'll resolve the thread, I fixed it." | Resolve with the commit reference or a reply so the reviewer can verify. |

## Red Flags

- A merged change with no PR, or a PR with no ticket id in the title.
- A PR merged with unresolved threads or red checks.
- A release without a tag or a changelog entry.
- A ticket whose state disagrees with its PR.

## Verification

- [ ] Every merged change has a PR whose title starts with the ticket id and whose URL is on the ticket.
- [ ] Every reviewed-class PR has inline comments and a submitted review with a verdict.
- [ ] All threads resolved with a commit or reply before merge; CI green.
- [ ] Releases are tagged per semver with a changelog entry.
