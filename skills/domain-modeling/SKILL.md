name: domain-modeling
description: Derives explicit, strongly typed domain models from requirements in any language: entities, value objects, typed identifiers, sum and product types, invariants, lifecycle states, contracts between parts, aggregate-level validation with structured errors, and a single source of truth for each contract, keeping static typing and runtime validation separate. Use when a principal engineer defines the shared model in an HLD, when a staff engineer implements or extends a module's domain types, or when a bug traces back to an ambiguous concept, a stringly typed API, or an impossible state.

# Domain Modeling

## Overview

Domain concepts become types, and types become the contract between everyone working on the feature. A good domain model makes invalid states unrepresentable, keeps business truth on the backend, and lets a reader and a type checker answer "what is this, what does it accept, what does it produce, what is invalid, and where exactly did it fail" without reverse-engineering dictionaries, strings, and conditionals.

The ideas here are language- and domain-neutral. A full worked example in Python for a workflow-graph domain is in `references/typed-workflow-domain-python.md`; use it for mechanics, not as the rule.

## When to Use

- Writing the shared model section of an HLD.
- Implementing or extending domain types in a service, especially in a foundation task.
- A bug traces back to an ambiguous concept, a raw string standing in for a type, or an impossible state.
- Designing contracts between parts (ports, handlers, executors, adapters) or validating an aggregate (a graph, a workflow, an order with lines).
- NOT for UI view models or transport DTOs in isolation; model them as translations of the domain model.

## Principles

1. **Model the domain, not the storage or wire format.** JSON, rows, and maps are never the primary model. Parse at the edge into typed objects, operate on types, serialize on the way out.
2. **Explicit types over stringly typed APIs.** A string is an identifier or a wire value, never a stand-in for a concept. A type alias that erases the distinction (`Image = string`) is not a type; use nominal or branded types.
3. **Separate three things**: the domain value (what flows), the contract (what a part accepts or produces), and the runtime instance. Name each.
4. **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** Sum types for alternatives and lifecycle states, product types for data that belongs together, enums for closed sets, typed identifiers per entity. Never a set of boolean flags or a struct of nullable fields where variants belong.
5. **Discriminators for polymorphic serialized values.** A tagged union with a stable wire identifier; never a class or type name as the persistent identifier, because names change in refactors and wire ids are contract.
6. **Static typing and runtime validation solve different problems.** Static types keep developers honest inside the code; runtime validation guards data that arrives from outside (HTTP, database, queue, files, users). Do not expect the type checker to validate external data, and do not use runtime checks as a substitute for good types inside. Generic parameters are erased or unreliable at runtime in most languages: keep explicit runtime type metadata next to the static type when runtime dispatch needs it.
7. **Contracts are part of the type.** A part's named, typed inputs and outputs are on the part itself; references point at the precise thing (the port, not just the node). Return the narrowest correct type. Use typed named records for input and output sets, not maps with known keys. `Any`, `object`, and unbounded maps are escape hatches, isolated at a boundary and documented.
8. **One source of truth per contract.** Parsing, validation, dispatch, UI schema, and serialization derive from one specification object; a registry or dispatch map is never the domain model. But do not over-abstract before repeated structure exists: start with the handful of concrete types the domain has.
9. **Aggregate-level invariants are their own validation layer.** Field validation cannot see cross-object rules (references exist, types are compatible, required inputs are wired, no structural cycles where a DAG is required). Validate them explicitly, in a deterministic order from structural to semantic, collect independent errors instead of stopping at the first, and keep the algorithm independent of the validation framework so it can be reused by tests, tools, and editors.
10. **Errors are structured and actionable.** Every error carries a location that identifies the offending object (`connections[2]`, `nodes[4].scale`), says what is wrong, what was expected, what was received, and how to fix it. Report the full path of a cycle and the edge that closes it, not "cycle detected". Never wrap a domain error in a generic exception that loses this.
11. **Invariants live near the thing they constrain.** An entity rule on the entity, an aggregate rule in aggregate validation, an execution rule in the execution layer; never one giant validator.
12. **Behavior contracts are structural; inheritance is for shared implementation only.** Prefer interfaces or protocols that implementations satisfy without inheriting; use base classes when there is genuinely shared state or lifecycle. Composition over inheritance.
13. **Small typed dispatch, not giant conditionals.** Node-, kind-, or variant-specific behavior lives in typed handlers selected by the discriminator; as variants grow, move to declarative registration from the single source of truth.
14. **Structural cycles are not runtime loops.** Retry, iteration, map, conditional execution are explicit control-flow constructs, never arbitrary cycles in a definition that is supposed to be a DAG.
15. **Domain metadata is immutable, names are domain names, aliases clarify.** Freeze specifications and port descriptors; name things `source_port` and `workflow_definition`, not `data`, `item`, `payload`; an alias must add meaning, never hide it.

## Process

1. **Extract the language**: list every noun and verb in the PRD and existing docs. Merge synonyms; split homonyms. Record the glossary in the HLD or service `LLD.md`.
2. **Classify each concept**: entity (identity and lifecycle), value object (compared by value), aggregate root (owns consistency of a cluster), event (something that happened), policy (a rule that decides), contract (what a part accepts or produces).
3. **Define identities**: a typed identifier per entity (`OrderId`, not `string`); who generates it; whether it is exposed externally; the stable wire identifier for each polymorphic kind.
4. **Write invariants** per entity and aggregate: the rules that must always hold. Each becomes a constructor guard, a type, or an aggregate validator, and a test.
5. **Model lifecycle** as a state machine for entities with states: a closed set of states as a sum type, allowed transitions, guards. Never free strings.
6. **Define contracts**: for each part, its named typed inputs and outputs, and what references it accepts. Decide the single specification object other layers derive from.
7. **Separate layers**: API model (what clients see), application model (use-case inputs and outputs), domain model (rules), persistence model (storage). Write explicit translations where the layers differ; collapse layers only when they are genuinely identical and record that decision.
8. **Design aggregate validation**: the ordered list of cross-object checks, the structured error shape with locations, and the reusable algorithms behind it.
9. **Write the types** in the service language with the strictness the global `CONVENTIONS.md` requires, using the mapping below. Put them in the LLD and in code in the foundation task.
10. **Prove it**: one test per invariant, per illegal transition, per aggregate check (valid and invalid, including every shape of a structural error), per error location and message.

## Mapping the ideas to a language

| Idea | TypeScript | Python | Go |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sum type / variants | discriminated union with a literal tag | `Literal`-tagged classes in a `Union` with a discriminator (Pydantic) | sealed interface with a marker method and a `switch` on concrete types |
| Product type | `interface` / `type` with required fields | dataclass or Pydantic model | struct |
| Closed set | string-literal union or `enum` | `Enum` / `Literal` | named type with typed constants |
| Typed identifier | branded type (`string & { __brand: 'OrderId' }`) | `NewType` or a small value class | named type (`type OrderId string`) with a constructor |
| Parse at the edge | zod / valibot schema → typed value | Pydantic model validation | decoder + validator returning the domain type |
| Behavior contract | `interface` (structural) | `Protocol` (structural) | `interface` (structural) |
| Named typed input/output set | object type | `TypedDict` | struct |
| Runtime type metadata alongside erased generics | a descriptor object with the tag and a validator | a frozen descriptor with `type_id` and the class | a descriptor with the tag and a decode function |
| Immutable metadata | `readonly` / `as const` | `@dataclass(frozen=True)`, `Final` | unexported fields + constructor functions |
| Structured error with location | error object `{ path, message, expected, received }` | validation error with `loc` | error type with a path field, wrapped, never flattened |

## Model record

```markdown
### <Entity or contract>
- Kind: entity | value object | aggregate root | event | policy | contract
- Identity: <typed id, generator, exposure> · Wire id: <stable tag>
- Fields: <name: type> (closed sets as enums or sum types; no nullable-everything)
- Invariants:
  - <rule> → enforced by <type | constructor | aggregate validator>
- States and transitions: <state → state (guard)>
- Inputs / outputs (contracts): <name: type>
- Owned by: <service>
- Translations: API ↔ domain ↔ persistence (which fields differ)
- Aggregate checks it participates in: <ordered list>
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A string status field is simpler." | It admits every typo as a state. A sum type or enum costs one line. |
| "A map of string to value is flexible." | It loses which key carries which type. A named typed record keeps the relationship and gives autocomplete. |
| "One model for API, domain, and DB saves code." | It couples the client to the storage schema; every change becomes a migration and an API break. |
| "Invariants are enforced in the service layer." | Then every caller must remember. Enforce in the type or constructor; aggregate rules in one explicit validator. |
| "The type checker validates the input." | It validates code, not data. External data is parsed at the edge; the two are different problems. |
| "The generic parameter tells us the type at runtime." | In most languages it is erased or unreliable. Keep explicit runtime metadata next to the static type. |
| "The registry is the model." | A dispatch map loses inputs, outputs, and schema. Derive the registry from a specification object. |
| "'Cycle detected' is enough." | Nobody can fix that. Report the full path, the closing edge, and the location. |
| "Abstract now, it will scale." | Three variants do not justify factories of factories. Abstract when repetition is real. |
| "The client can compute eligibility." | Business truth lives on the backend. Clients render it. |

## Red Flags

- A free-form string for a closed set or an identifier; a type alias to a primitive standing in for a domain concept.
- Boolean flag combinations or nullable-everything structs where a sum type belongs.
- A type or class name used as a persistent wire identifier.
- `Any`, `object`, or `map[string]any` in a domain signature; a return type wider than the contract.
- Contracts duplicated across node, executor, and UI schema that can drift.
- A giant conditional dispatching on a string; runtime code comparing class names or peeking into serialized dictionaries.
- An aggregate validator that stops at the first error, has no locations, or is welded to the validation framework.
- An entity with no invariants listed; domain rules duplicated in a client; persistence fields in API responses.

## Verification

- [ ] Every concept in the glossary has a model record and a type in code; every polymorphic kind has a stable wire id.
- [ ] Every invariant, illegal transition, and aggregate check has a test, including every shape of structural error the domain can produce.
- [ ] Layer translations are explicit or the collapse is recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
- [ ] Contracts have one source of truth; no registry or dispatch map is the model.
- [ ] Aggregate errors carry locations and actionable messages; algorithms are testable without the validation framework.
- [ ] No `Any`/`object`/unbounded map in domain signatures without a documented boundary reason.
- [ ] Types match the HLD key interfaces.
