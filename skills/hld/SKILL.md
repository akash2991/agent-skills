description: How to write a High-Level Design from templates/HLD.md — goals, non-goals, assumptions, constraints, scale estimations, unified cross-service boundaries with one owner per responsibility, domain model and glossary, key API interfaces by name, interactions as sequence diagrams, tradeoffs with linked ADRs, dependencies and infra, SLOs, high-level observability, one-way doors, and what is left to the LLD, for a feature or a service from an approved or reviewed PRD. Use when you write, review, or are asked for an HLD, design doc, architecture proposal, tech spec, or "how should we design X", or when an engineer has a reviewed PRD that touches more than one module or service, or introduces one, and before planning or implementation.

# High-Level Design

## Overview

Two altitudes, one skill. The **project** architecture in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` says which services exist, what each is for, and where the API reference is. A **feature or service** `HLD.md` says the boundaries, the APIs by name, the domain model, and the scale it is sized for. Anyone with this skill may write either; keep to the altitude of the document you are writing. An HLD makes parallel work possible without rework: it fixes boundaries and API names, and deliberately not internals or exact contracts, which belong to `lld`.

The HLD is kept very high level and **calls out what is left to figure out in the LLD**. Not every feature needs an HLD or LLD. The anatomy is `templates/HLD.md`; the process below fills it.

## When to Use

- A reviewed PRD touches more than one module or service, or introduces a new one.
- A cross-service interaction must change.
- Asked for an HLD, design doc, architecture proposal, tech spec, or "how should we design X".
- NOT for a single-service change with existing APIs; update the service `HLD.md` directly in the PR.
- NOT for internals: folder layout, types, exact contracts, and patterns belong to `lld`.

## Process

Each step fills a section of `templates/HLD.md`; a section is skipped with one line saying why.

1. **Read** the PRD, every affected service's `HLD.md`, the project's `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/DOMAIN.md`. List every entity, actor, flow, and metric the PRD implies.
2. **Goals, non-goals, assumptions, constraints** come first; they bound every later choice.
3. **Scale estimations.** Initially it is low. Write the numbers the design is sized for and do not solve for scale that is not established.
4. **Service boundaries**: which services exist, which change, whether a new service is justified. Every responsibility has one owner. A new service needs the user's decision.
5. **Domain model and glossary**: entities, value objects, typed ids, states as sum types, invariants. One vocabulary across services, kept in `docs/DOMAIN.md`.
6. **API interfaces**: which APIs exist, which services interact through them, and the gist of request and response. The actual contract is decided in the LLD and lives in OpenAPI.
7. **Interactions** for the critical paths as Mermaid sequence diagrams, showing which service decides what. Backend owns business truth; clients render it.
8. **Tradeoffs and one-way doors**: what the chosen design gives up, and an ADR linked for every decision worth preserving. Options, rejections, and rationale live in the ADR, never restated here.
9. **Dependencies and infra**: external services, packages, Terraform resources, CI/CD needs, data migrations.
10. **SLOs** for the critical paths at the level the PRD justifies; **observability** at high level: metrics and log points (`../../references/metrics-and-logging.md`). Detail belongs in code.
11. **Sketches for the LLD** only where parallel work needs them before the LLD exists; **left to the LLD** says what this document does not decide.
12. **Diagrams as code**: `hld.drawio` next to the file, Mermaid inline.
13. **Hand off**: write it where `../../references/documentation-map.md` says; give it to the user for review; then plan with `planning-and-task-breakdown`, then `lld`.

## Interaction with other skills

- Upstream: `prd-writing`; the HLD starts from a reviewed PRD.
- Alongside: `domain-modeling` for the glossary and domain models; `adrs` for every decision worth preserving; `documentation` for how the document is written, rendered, and stored.
- Downstream: `planning-and-task-breakdown`, then `lld`, which decides the internals and exact contracts this document leaves open.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll specify the internals too, to be safe." | That makes the HLD stale on day one. Internals and exact contracts belong to the LLD. |
| "Diagrams can be drawn later in a tool." | Diagrams are code, committed with the HLD. |
| "SLOs and observability are operational, not design." | They shape timeouts, idempotency, and what to measure. State them now, at high level. |
| "I'll explain the options and rationale here, the ADR can come later." | The HLD links the ADR; options and rationale live only there. Write it with the HLD. |
| "The interface can be defined during implementation." | Then two services implement two interfaces. Names and interactions come first; the contract follows in the LLD. |
| "We may need to scale, so design for it now." | Design for the estimated scale. Record scale as a later concern. |
| "The design is obvious, skip the review." | Every HLD, LLD, and PRD is reviewed by the user. |
| "Every feature needs a full HLD." | Not every feature needs an HLD or LLD, and sections can be skipped with a reason. |

## Red Flags

- A responsibility with two owners or none.
- No scale estimation, no non-goals, or no one-way doors.
- An exact contract or a folder layout beyond the sketches section.
- A one-way door or technology choice with no linked ADR, or options and rationale restated in the HLD.
- A diagram that exists only as an image.
- An HLD treated as approved before the user reviewed it.
- An HLD that does not say what is left to the LLD.

## Verification

- [ ] Every PRD story maps to boundaries and named APIs in the HLD.
- [ ] Every template section is filled or skipped with a reason; scale and one-way doors are present.
- [ ] Every decision worth preserving has an ADR linked from the tradeoffs or one-way doors.
- [ ] The domain model is in `docs/DOMAIN.md` and consistent across services.
- [ ] Diagrams are committed as code next to the HLD.
- [ ] What is left to the LLD is called out.
- [ ] The user has reviewed the HLD.
