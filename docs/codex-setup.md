# Using agent-skills with Codex

This repository is also a [Codex plugin](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build). The same root-level `skills/` directory used by Claude Code is consumed by Codex, so no files are copied or duplicated.

## Install

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add addyosmani/agent-skills
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

> Requires Codex CLI v0.122 or later. On older releases the command was `codex marketplace add`. See the [Codex CLI docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli).

The first command registers this repository as the `agent-skills` marketplace. The second command installs and enables the `agent-skills` plugin from that marketplace. Start a new Codex session after installation so the skills are discovered.

Local clones work too:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/your/clone
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

## Usage

After install, invoke a skill in Codex chat with `@` (e.g. `@spec-driven-development`) or just describe the task and let Codex pick the right skill. The skills under `skills/` are available.

[Codex uses progressive disclosure](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills): it starts with each skill's `name` and `description`, chooses skills on demand, then loads the full `SKILL.md` only when selected. Do not also paste `using-agent-skills/SKILL.md` into `AGENTS.md`, a system prompt, or other always-on context: that stacks the pack's meta-router on Codex's native router and adds unnecessary routing work. The meta-skill can remain installed with the pack; the warning is specifically against preloading its full instructions.

## How it works

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex plugin manifest at the repo root. Points `skills` at `./skills/` and provides the metadata required by Codex.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — marketplace entry declaring the repo root (`./`) as the plugin source.
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — unchanged. Codex and Claude Code share the same `name` + `description` frontmatter format, so one file serves both platforms.

Slash commands in `.claude/commands/` and personas in `agents/` stay Claude Code-specific. The `SessionStart` script under `hooks/` is a standalone helper for hosts without native skill routing and is not wired by either plugin. On Codex, invoke the underlying skill directly instead of the slash command (e.g. `@spec-driven-development` instead of `/spec`).

## Install the brain into a project

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` from the project root, skills from `.agents/skills/`, and custom prompts from `~/.codex/prompts/` only (prompts are not read from the repository). The brain's `/brain` and `/brain-status` prompts ship in `.codex/prompts/` in the same format Codex expects (`description` and `argument-hint` front matter, `$ARGUMENTS` for the arguments); copy them into the home directory.

```bash
node scripts/build-brain.js                            # in this repository
cp build/AGENTS.md build/SOUL.md /path/to/project/
cp -r build/references build/templates /path/to/project/
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.agents
cp -r build/skills /path/to/project/.agents/skills
cp -r build/agents /path/to/project/.agents/agents     # personas, read by /prompts:brain
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
cp build/.codex/prompts/brain*.md ~/.codex/prompts/
```

Then in the project:

```
/prompts:brain backend-engineer fix the login timeout
/prompts:brain-status
```

Codex runs subagents itself; the prompts only tell the main agent to show the plan and ask for each subagent's model, harness, and effort before starting one. MCP servers for Linear and GitHub go in `~/.codex/config.toml`; see [references/tool-auth.md](../references/tool-auth.md).
